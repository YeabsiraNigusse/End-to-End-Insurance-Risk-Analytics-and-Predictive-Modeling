INSURANCE RISK ANALYTICS - HYPOTHESIS TESTING SUMMARY
============================================================
Analysis Date: 2025-06-18 19:21:18

Total hypotheses tested: 4

REJECTED HYPOTHESES (4):
  • H1_provinces
    Evidence: Significant differences found in: claim_frequency, claim_severity, loss_ratio

  • H2_zip_codes
    Evidence: Significant differences found in: claim_frequency, claim_severity, loss_ratio

  • H3_zip_margin
    Evidence: Significant differences found in: margin

  • H4_gender
    Evidence: Significant differences found in: margin

FAILED TO REJECT HYPOTHESES (0):
BUSINESS RECOMMENDATIONS:
  1. Consider implementing province-specific pricing strategies due to significant risk variations across provinces.
  2. Implement zip code-level risk adjustments in pricing models to account for geographic risk variations.
  3. Review pricing strategy by zip code to optimize profit margins and ensure competitive positioning.
  4. Consider gender-based risk factors in underwriting (subject to regulatory compliance and fairness considerations).

DETAILED RESULTS:
============================================================

H₁: Risk differences across provinces
-------------------------------------
Null Hypothesis: H₀: There are no risk differences across provinces

CLAIM_FREQUENCY TEST:
  Test: Chi-Square Test of Independence
  Statistic: 104.1909
  P-value: 0.000000
  Significant: True
  Interpretation: The association is significant (p=0.0000) with a negligible effect size (Cramér's V=0.0102)

CLAIM_SEVERITY TEST:
  Test: Kruskal-Wallis Test
  Statistic: 106.0927
  P-value: 0.000000
  Significant: True
  Interpretation: The group differences are significant (p=0.0000) with a small effect size (ε²=0.0353)

LOSS_RATIO TEST:
  Test: Kruskal-Wallis Test
  Statistic: 93.6966
  P-value: 0.000000
  Significant: True
  Interpretation: The group differences are significant (p=0.0000) with a negligible effect size (ε²=0.0001)

CONCLUSION:
  Decision: REJECT NULL HYPOTHESIS
  Evidence: Significant differences found in: claim_frequency, claim_severity, loss_ratio

  Significant: True
  Interpretation: The association is significant (p=0.0000) with a negligible effect size (Cramér's V=0.0153)

CLAIM_SEVERITY TEST:
  Test: Kruskal-Wallis Test
  Statistic: 41.4278
  P-value: 0.000004
  Significant: True
  Interpretation: The group differences are significant (p=0.0000) with a small effect size (ε²=0.0318)

LOSS_RATIO TEST:
  Test: Kruskal-Wallis Test
  Statistic: 47.7859
  P-value: 0.000000
  Significant: True
  Interpretation: The group differences are significant (p=0.0000) with a negligible effect size (ε²=0.0002)

CONCLUSION:
  Decision: REJECT NULL HYPOTHESIS
  Evidence: Significant differences found in: claim_frequency, claim_severity, loss_ratio


H₃: Margin differences between zip codes
----------------------------------------
Null Hypothesis: H₀: There are no significant margin (profit) differences between zip codes

MARGIN TEST:
  Test: Kruskal-Wallis Test
  Statistic: 4931.1403
  P-value: 0.000000
  Significant: True
  Interpretation: The group differences are significant (p=0.0000) with a small effect size (ε²=0.0158)

CONCLUSION:
  Decision: REJECT NULL HYPOTHESIS
  Evidence: Significant differences found in: margin


H₄: Risk differences between genders
------------------------------------

CLAIM_FREQUENCY TEST:
  Test: Chi-Square Test of Independence
  Statistic: 0.0037
  P-value: 0.951464
  Significant: False
  Interpretation: The association is not significant (p=0.9515) with a negligible effect size (Cramér's V=0.0003)

CLAIM_SEVERITY TEST:
  Test: Mann-Whitney U Test
  Statistic: 524.5000
  P-value: 0.223513
  Significant: False
  Interpretation: The difference is not significant (p=0.2235) with a small effect size (r=0.2029)

LOSS_RATIO TEST:
  Test: Mann-Whitney U Test
  Statistic: 32908460.0000
  P-value: 0.635080
  Significant: False
  Interpretation: The difference is not significant (p=0.6351) with a negligible effect size (r=-0.0006)
