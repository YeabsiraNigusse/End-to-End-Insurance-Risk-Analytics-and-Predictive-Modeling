INSURANCE RISK ANALYTICS - HYPOTHESIS TESTING SUMMARY
============================================================
Analysis Date: 2025-06-18 16:12:41

Total hypotheses tested: 4

REJECTED HYPOTHESES (2):
  • H1_provinces
    Evidence: Significant differences found in: claim_frequency, claim_severity, loss_ratio

  • H4_gender
    Evidence: Significant differences found in: margin

FAILED TO REJECT HYPOTHESES (2):
  • H2_zip_codes
    Evidence: No significant differences found in any test

  • H3_zip_margin
    Evidence: No significant differences found in any test

BUSINESS RECOMMENDATIONS:
  1. Consider implementing province-specific pricing strategies due to significant risk variations across provinces.
  2. Consider gender-based risk factors in underwriting (subject to regulatory compliance and fairness considerations).

DETAILED RESULTS:
============================================================

H₁: Risk differences across provinces
-------------------------------------
Null Hypothesis: H₀: There are no risk differences across provinces

CLAIM_FREQUENCY TEST:
  Test: Chi-Square Test of Independence
  Statistic: 50.4073
  P-value: 0.000000
  Significant: True
  Interpretation: The association is significant (p=0.0000) with a negligible effect size (Cramér's V=0.0710)

CLAIM_SEVERITY TEST:
  Test: Kruskal-Wallis Test
  Statistic: 26.7088
  P-value: 0.000794
  Significant: True
  Interpretation: The group differences are significant (p=0.0008) with a negligible effect size (ε²=0.0072)

LOSS_RATIO TEST:
  Test: Kruskal-Wallis Test
  Statistic: 47.1029
  P-value: 0.000000
  Significant: True
  Interpretation: The group differences are significant (p=0.0000) with a negligible effect size (ε²=0.0039)

CONCLUSION:
  Decision: REJECT NULL HYPOTHESIS
  Evidence: Significant differences found in: claim_frequency, claim_severity, loss_ratio


H₂: Risk differences between zip codes
--------------------------------------
Null Hypothesis: H₀: There are no risk differences between zip codes

CLAIM_FREQUENCY TEST:
  Test: Chi-Square Test of Independence
  Statistic: 3.8239
  P-value: 0.922617
  Significant: False
  Interpretation: The association is not significant (p=0.9226) with a small effect size (Cramér's V=0.2504)

CLAIM_SEVERITY TEST:
  Test: Kruskal-Wallis Test
  Statistic: 7.1105
  P-value: 0.625613
  Significant: False
  Interpretation: The group differences are not significant (p=0.6256) with a negligible effect size (ε²=-0.2099)

LOSS_RATIO TEST:
  Test: Kruskal-Wallis Test
  Statistic: 3.1851
  P-value: 0.956504
  Significant: False
  Interpretation: The group differences are not significant (p=0.9565) with a negligible effect size (ε²=-0.1140)

CONCLUSION:
  Decision: FAIL TO REJECT NULL HYPOTHESIS
  Evidence: No significant differences found in any test


H₃: Margin differences between zip codes
----------------------------------------
Null Hypothesis: H₀: There are no significant margin (profit) differences between zip codes

MARGIN TEST:
  Test: Kruskal-Wallis Test
  Statistic: 3.0237
  P-value: 0.963347
  Significant: False
  Interpretation: The group differences are not significant (p=0.9633) with a negligible effect size (ε²=-0.1172)

CONCLUSION:
  Decision: FAIL TO REJECT NULL HYPOTHESIS
  Evidence: No significant differences found in any test


H₄: Risk differences between genders
------------------------------------
Null Hypothesis: H₀: There are no significant risk differences between Women and Men

CLAIM_FREQUENCY TEST:
  Test: Chi-Square Test of Independence
  Statistic: 2.6777
  P-value: 0.101761
  Significant: False
  Interpretation: The association is not significant (p=0.1018) with a negligible effect size (Cramér's V=0.0167)

CLAIM_SEVERITY TEST:
  Test: Mann-Whitney U Test
  Statistic: 809645.0000
  P-value: 0.082172
  Significant: False
  Interpretation: The difference is not significant (p=0.0822) with a negligible effect size (r=-0.0402)

LOSS_RATIO TEST:
  Test: Mann-Whitney U Test
  Statistic: 11703299.0000
  P-value: 0.101187
  Significant: False
  Interpretation: The difference is not significant (p=0.1012) with a negligible effect size (r=-0.0149)

MARGIN TEST:
  Test: Mann-Whitney U Test
  Statistic: 12725832.0000
  P-value: 0.000000
  Significant: True
  Interpretation: The difference is significant (p=0.0000) with a small effect size (r=-0.1036)

CONCLUSION:
  Decision: REJECT NULL HYPOTHESIS
  Evidence: Significant differences found in: margin
